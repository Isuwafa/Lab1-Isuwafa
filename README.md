# Lab 1: Grade Generator & Organizer

A two-part project consisting of a Python-based grade calculator and a Bash script for organizing CSV files.

## Project Overview

This project includes:
1. **grade-generator.py** - An interactive Python application that calculates student grades
2. **organizer.sh** - A Bash script that archives CSV files with timestamps

## Part 1: Python Grade Generator

### Features

- Interactive prompts for assignment details
- Input validation for grades, categories, and weights
- Weighted grade calculations
- Formative (FA) and Summative (SA) category tracking
- GPA calculation (0-5.0 scale)
- PASS/FAIL determination based on 50% threshold in both categories
- Identification of assignments requiring resubmission (grade < 50%)
- Console summary output
- CSV file export

### Usage

```bash
python3 grade-generator.py
```

### Input Requirements

For each assignment, you'll be prompted for:
- **Assignment Name**: Any descriptive text
- **Category**: FA (Formative) or SA (Summative)
- **Grade**: Number between 0-100
- **Weight**: Positive number representing the assignment weight

### Validation Rules

1. **Grades**: Must be between 0 and 100
2. **Categories**: Must be "FA" or "SA" (case-insensitive)
3. **Weights**: Must be positive numbers
4. **Pass/Fail**: Student must achieve ≥50% in both FA and SA categories

### Calculation Logic

- **Weighted Grade**: `(Grade / 100) × Weight`
- **Category Total**: Sum of all weighted grades in that category
- **Final Grade**: `Total FA + Total SA`
- **GPA**: `(Final Grade / 100) × 5.0`

### Example Run

```
--- Enter Assignment Details ---
Assignment Name: Group Coding Lab
Category (FA/SA): FA
Grade Obtained (0-100): 19
Weight: 30

Assignment 'Group Coding Lab' added successfully!

Add another assignment? (y/n): y

--- Enter Assignment Details ---
Assignment Name: Discussion Forum
Category (FA/SA): FA
Grade Obtained (0-100): 56
Weight: 10

Assignment 'Discussion Forum' added successfully!

Add another assignment? (y/n): n
```

### Output Files

**grades.csv** - Contains all entered assignments in CSV format:
```csv
Assignment,Category,Grade,Weight
Group Coding Lab,FA,19,30
Discussion Forum,FA,56,10
General Quiz,FA,67,20
Pre-Summative,SA,45,15
Individual Lab,SA,81,25
```

## Part 2: Bash Organizer Script

### Features

- Automatically creates archive directory if needed
- Finds all CSV files in current directory
- Renames files with timestamps (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS format)
- Moves files to archive directory
- Logs all operations with file contents to organizer.log

### Usage

```bash
chmod +x organizer.sh

./organizer.sh
```

### What It Does

1. Checks for/creates an `archive` directory
2. Finds all `.csv` files in the current directory
3. For each CSV file:
   - Generates a timestamp
   - Creates new filename: `original-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv`
   - Logs the action and file contents to `organizer.log`
   - Moves file to archive directory

### Example

**Before:**
```
.
├── grade-generator.py
├── grades.csv
└── organizer.sh
```

**After:**
```
.
├── archive/
│   └── grades-20251116-143022.csv
├── grade-generator.py
├── organizer.log
└── organizer.sh
```

### Log File Format

The `organizer.log` file contains:
- Timestamp of archiving operation
- Original filename
- New filename with timestamp
- Complete file contents
- Operation status

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/n-elie7/Lab1-n-elie7
cd Lab1-n-elie7
```

2. Make the organizer script executable:
```bash
chmod +x organizer.sh
```

3. Run the grade generator:
```bash
python3 grade-generator.py
```

4. Archive the generated CSV:
```bash
./organizer.sh
```

## Testing the System

### Test Case 1: Passing Student

Enter the following assignments:
- Group Coding Lab: FA, 19, 30
- Discussion Forum: FA, 56, 10
- General Quiz: FA, 67, 20
- Pre-Summative: SA, 45, 15
- Individual Lab: SA, 81, 25

**Expected Results:**
- FA Total: 28.50 / 60
- SA Total: 27.00 / 40
- Final Grade: 55.50 / 100
- GPA: 2.78
- Status: PASS (both categories ≥50%)

### Test Case 2: Failing Student (Low SA)

Enter assignments where SA total < 50% of SA weights.

**Expected Result:** Status: FAIL

### Test Case 3: Archive Multiple Files

1. Run grade generator multiple times with different data
2. Run organizer script
3. Verify all CSV files are archived with unique timestamps

## File Structure

```
project/
├── grade-generator.py    # Python grade calculator
├── organizer.sh          # Bash archiving script
├── README.md            # This file
├── grades.csv           # Generated by Python script (before archiving)
├── archive/             # Created by organizer script
│   └── grades-*.csv     # Archived files
└── organizer.log        # Operation logs
```

## Error Handling

### Python Script
- Validates all numeric inputs
- Ensures grades are 0-100
- Checks category values
- Requires positive weights
- Handles empty assignment names

### Bash Script
- Creates archive directory if missing
- Handles case of no CSV files
- Logs errors to organizer.log
- Provides status feedback

## Key Implementation Details

### Validation
- Grade range enforcement (0-100%)
- Category validation (FA/SA only)
- Weight positivity checks
- Pass/Fail logic: requires ≥50% in BOTH categories

### CSV Format
- Header row: `Assignment,Category,Grade,Weight`
- Data rows with exact values as entered
- Standard CSV format compatible with Excel/Sheets

### Timestamp Format
- Pattern: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
- Example: 20251117-173022 (Nov 17, 2025, 17:30:22 PM)
- Ensures unique filenames for each archive operation

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Permission denied when running organizer.sh
```bash
chmod +x organizer.sh
```

**Issue**: Python script not found
```bash
python3 grade-generator.py
# or try:
python grade-generator.py
```

**Issue**: CSV not generated
- Ensure you complete at least one assignment entry
- Check write permissions in current directory
