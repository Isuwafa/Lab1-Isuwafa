Author: Suwafa Iradukunda
Course: Introduction to Python Programming and Databases
Institution: African Leadership University (ALU)
Term: 2025 September Term

This project contains two main components:

grade-generator.py
An interactive Python program that:

Collects assignment information (name, category, grade, and weight)

Validates all user input

Computes weighted formative (FA) and summative (SA) scores

Calculates final grade and GPA

Determines Pass/Fail status for each category and overall

Identifies required resubmissions based on failed formative assessments

Export all data into grades.csv

organizer.sh
A Bash shell script that:

Archives CSV files in the current folder

Generates timestamps for each archived file

Writes detailed logs into organizer.log

Moves renamed CSV files into an archive/ directory

Is fully executable in a bash environment (Git Bash / Linux / WSL)

🚀 How to Run the Python Program

Make sure Python is installed. Then run:

python3 grade-generator.py


Follow the prompts to input:

Assignment name

Category (FA/SA)

Grade

Weight

The program will automatically generate:

A grade summary

Pass/Fail status

Resubmission requirements

A grades.csv file

📦 How to Run the Archive Shell Script

The shell script must be executable.

✔ Step 1 — Open Git Bash in the project folder

Right-click inside the folder → “Git Bash Here”

✔ Step 2 — Make the script executable
chmod +x organizer.sh

✔ Step 3 — Run the script
./organizer.sh
